      <h2><a href="#about">About Me</a></h2>
      <p>My name is Jessica Zunuo Puozaa, and I'm a vibrant 20-year-old with roots in the beautiful Upper West Region of Ghana.
        Growing up in Daffiama, I was surrounded by the warmth of family and the rich cultural heritage of my community.
        As the youngest of five siblings, I've always been a bundle of energy, eager to explore and learn. I completed my primary 
          and junior school in the Upper West Region, but later chose to change my environment, so I chose OLA shs Ho, of 
          which I completed on September 20, 2023.</p> 

      <p>Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Ghana.
        My passion for numbers and problem-solving has led me to this exciting academic journey.
        I'm eager to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges and make a positive impact.
      
        <p>I aspire to specialize in either computer science or actuarial science in completing my undergraduate studies.
          Both fields align with my interest in mathematical problem-solving and offer exciting career opportunities.
          I'm particularly drawn to the blend of technical skills and analytical thinking required in these disciplines.</p>
      
        <p>Beyond my studies, I'm known for my friendly and outgoing personality.
          I enjoy spending time with friends and family, exploring new places, and trying out different cuisines. I like
            almost everything, but dislikes just a few things.</p>
    
        <p>I'm always up for a good laugh and love to create unforgettable memories.
          As I continue to grow and develop, I'm excited to see where my path will take me.</p>
